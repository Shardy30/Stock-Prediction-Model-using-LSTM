# MarketMagicAI: Stock Prediction Model using LSTM
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of a company using historical stock data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Data
The data used in this project is historical stock data for a specific company, including information such as the date, open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume. The data is collected from a financial data provider.

## Methods
The stock prediction model is built using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well suited for time series data. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data and tested on the testing data. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error.

## Results
The results show the performance of the model on the testing data and the predicted future stock prices. The predicted prices are also plotted against the actual prices for comparison.

## Usage
The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
To run the code, clone the repository and run the python script app.py. The data used in the project is collected from a financial data provider, and should be placed in the data.csv file.

## Conclusion
The stock prediction model can be used to predict future stock prices of a company, which can be useful for investors and traders in making informed decisions. This project demonstrates how to build a stock prediction model using LSTM, but the same approach can be applied to other types of time series data.
